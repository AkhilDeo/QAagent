format.

# For example:

## Prompt 1:
```
def remove_Occ(s,ch):
    """
    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
    """

```

## Completion 1:
```
    # Check if the character exists in the string.
    # If not, return the original string as there's nothing to remove.
    # Find the index of the first occurrence of the character.
    # Find the index of the last occurrence of the character.
    # Remove the first occurrence of the character from the string.
    # If the first and last occurrence are at different positions,
    # remove the last occurrence of the character from the string.
    # Return the modified string.
```

## Prompt 2:
```
def sort_matrix(M):
    """
    Write a function to sort a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows.
    """

```

## Completion 2:
```
    # Calculate the sum of each row in the matrix.
    # Sort the rows of the matrix based on their respective sums in ascending order.
    # Return the sorted matrix.
