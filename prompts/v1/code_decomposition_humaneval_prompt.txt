*Role**: You are a software programmer.

**Task**: As a programmer, you are required to break down the implementation of the function into simpler helper functions. The primary function should use these helper functions, but you should not implement the helper functions themselves. Using a Chain-of-Thought approach, generate an implementation of the primary function assuming that the helper functions are implemented.

**Code Formatting**: Please write code within a code block:
```
